 Function to control aserve's oscillators. 
 
 Arguments control the oscillator parameters. Setting the amplitude
 of an oscillator to 0.0 will switch it off.
 
 @param		oscillatorNumber	selects the oscillator: 0 - 15
 @param		frequency			sets the selected oscillator's frequency: 0.0Hz - 20000.0Hz
 @param		amplitude			sets the selected oscillator's amplitude: 0.0 to 1.0
 @param		wave				sets the selected oscillator's waveform: 0 = sine, 1 = pulse, 2 = saw
 
 Example usage:
 @code
 //Set the first oscillator to a 1kHz sinusoidal tone at max amplitude  
 aserveOscillator(0, 1000, 1.0, 0);
